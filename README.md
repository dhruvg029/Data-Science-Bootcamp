# Data Science Repertoire  
This repository consists of all the implementations of data science and machine learning related algorithms and theories. It is divided into 11 parts from basics of python to implementing Hadoop and Spark related terminologies in python using PySpark. This repository will be updated whenever required. 

## Tools and Resources

**0) Introduction to Python**
1. Python Basics
   - [Basics and Crumbs:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/0_Introduction%20to%20Python/1_Python%20Basics/1_python_basics.ipynb) Includes extreme basics of Python like fundamental and advanced data types, variables, loops, if and else statements, break and continue statements and range() function.
   - [Strings and List Operations:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/0_Introduction%20to%20Python/1_Python%20Basics/2_string_list_operations.ipynb) Discussed about the string and list in built methods, slicing and indexing, nesting of lists along with different string and list operations.
   - [Functions and Containers:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/0_Introduction%20to%20Python/1_Python%20Basics/3_containers_functions.ipynb) Continued about the operations of advanced data types like tuples, dictionaries and sets and discussed about creating functions in python.
3. Python Advanced
   - [OOPs and APIs:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/tree/main/0_Introduction%20to%20Python/2_Python%20Advanced/1_OOPs_Libraries_APIs) Discussed about object oriented programming in python, working with APIs in python and how to get text and responses from a website, and examples of exception handling with the help of try and except blocks.

**1) Mathematics and Statistics**
1. [Descriptive Statistics:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/1_Mathematics%20and%20Statistics/1_descriptive_statistics.ipynb) Includes concepts related to meaures of central tendency such as mean, median, mode and terms like variance, standard deviation, quartiles, percentiles and many more.
2. [Inferential Statistics:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/1_Mathematics%20and%20Statistics/2_inferential_statistics.ipynb) Includes concepts related to basics of probability, marginal, joint and conditional probability along with creating frequency tables and infer from them. 
3. [Probability Distributions:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/1_Mathematics%20and%20Statistics/3_probability_distributions.ipynb) Includes code of discrete distributions like binomial, bernoulli, poisson and and continuous like normal distributions. This concept also includes distributions like uniform and exponential distributions.
4. [Hypothesis Testing:](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/1_Mathematics%20and%20Statistics/4_hypothesis_testing.ipynb) Demonstrates one sample (Z-test and T-test), two sample (Z-test and T-test) and Chi-Square test in detail by defining null and alternative hypothesis using specific python modules and libraries.
5. [Random and Stratified Sampling](https://github.com/dhruvg029/Data-Science-Bootcamp/blob/main/1_Mathematics%20and%20Statistics/5_sampling.ipynb) Includes examples which use random sampling and stratified sampling in python with the help of real data.
